## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Forge Workflow initialized with Forge Terminal Workflow Architect

### Changed
- Pre-commit test gate now enforces Article V's three-layer separation rather than a
  co-located filename convention. `.forge/test-coverage-policy.json` declares which layer
  covers which paths; coverage stays mandatory and the gate still blocks an untested file
  under `lib/`, but a Server Component is no longer asked for a mocked unit test it could
  not meaningfully have.

### Fixed

### Removed
